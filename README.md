Project 5 FYS4150
Will update some files during the night (after deadline 22.12.2019). Had extended deadline because of sickness.

Have problems pushing files to repository due to deleting a file that were to large to be commited. Have created a new repository (https://github.com/AndreasFagerheim/Project-5-1) for the folder "Update after deadline". Have been workingon trying to push the new file for hours so this was the temperary solution i could come up with.
